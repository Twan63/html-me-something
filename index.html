            <h2>Career Related</h2>

                <p> I realized that the IT field was for me. While in college I worked at a place called 
                    the CAPP office (Center of Academic and Perfessional Perfomance) I was promoted to student manager where I lead 13 student workers. 
                    This was my first view of the IT field on a small scale but I noticed the intricacies of maintaining a LAN that depends solely on 
                    the storage that is within it.
